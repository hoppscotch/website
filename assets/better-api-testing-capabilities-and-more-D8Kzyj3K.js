You can manage your server configurations directly from the self-host admin dashboard. You can configure authentication providers, as well as manage your SMTP settings from the dashboard. For self-hosted enterprise versions, you can use the dashboard to configure your license and set up extra services like audit logs. </p><p class="mb-8 mt-4"> The Hoppscotch Desktop app has also received numerous updates and improvements! The size of the Hoppscotch app installer on a Mac has been reduced to just 10MB! </p><p class="mb-8 mt-4"> We&#39;ve introduced several other improvements, including the option to add subpath-based access for the admin dashboard and Hoppscotch backend instead of port-based access. With this update, you can choose between configuring port-based access or subpath-based access. If subpath-based access is enabled, you can access the Hoppscotch backend and admin dashboard at domain-name.com/backend and domain-name.com/admin. We will gradually migrate away from port-based access for the self-host admin dashboard and backend in the future. </p><p class="mb-8 mt-4"> Spotlight search has received some enhancements.
