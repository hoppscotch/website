              2023 has been an exciting and productive year for us here at
              Hoppscotch. We look back on a year of progress and momentum with

            <p class="mb-8 mt-4">
              The analogy of a journey is fitting. When one embarks on a quest,
              the focus remains on the path ahead—the goals, the milestones, the
              aspirations. Yet, every traveler knows the significance of
              occasionally glancing back. It's in these moments of reflection
              that the magnitude of progress becomes apparent, instilling a
              sense of accomplishment and rejuvenation.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-8 mt-4">
              At Hoppscotch, the journey is about restoring the enchantment in
              software. It's about creating tools that empower the next wave of
              impactful companies, aiding them in their unique paths to success.
              But today, the spotlight isn't on the destination; it's on the
              trail traversed. It's about cherishing the journey of the past 365
              days—a journey marked by growth, camaraderie, and innovation.
