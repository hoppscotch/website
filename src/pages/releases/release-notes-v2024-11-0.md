#### Execute Requests with the New Collection Runner 🏃

Introducing the collection runner in the Hoppscotch API testing client! This feature lets you automate the execution of multiple requests within a collection.

#### Send Binary Files in Your Request Body 0️⃣1️⃣

We’ve enhanced binary file support, enabling you to seamlessly include binary file content-types in your API requests.

#### View Detailed Import Summaries 📊

We’ve improved data imports with a comprehensive summary feature. This overview provides key details such as number of collections, requests etc. ensuring greater visibility and a smoother user experience.

#### Specify Content Types for Request Body Form Data 🗂️

We now allow flexible content-type customization for multipart/form-data requests. While file content-types are handled automatically, you can override them for specific parameters.
