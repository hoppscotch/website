#### Execute Requests with the New Collection Runner

Introducing the collection runner in the Hoppscotch API testing client! This feature lets you automate the execution of multiple requests within a collection.

#### Send Binary Files in Your Request Body

We’ve enhanced binary file support, enabling you to seamlessly include binary file content-types in your API requests.

#### View Detailed Import Summaries

We’ve improved data imports with a comprehensive summary feature. This overview provides key details such as number of collections, requests etc. ensuring greater visibility and a smoother user experience.

#### Specify Content Types for Request Body Form Data

We now allow flexible content-type customization for multipart/form-data requests. While file content-types are handled automatically, you can override them for specific parameters.

#### Generate Queries from GraphQL Documentation
We’ve simplified GraphQL development with an intelligent query generation feature. By using your GraphQL documentation, you can quickly generate accurate, well-structured queries
