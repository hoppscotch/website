#### User Groups for Workspaces

You can now create and manage **User Groups** to streamline workspace access. Group users into teams and assign them to workspaces in one go.  
*Coming soon: automated team assignment to groups!*

#### Self-Host Admin Dashboard UX Improvements

We’ve upgraded the **user experience** of the Self-Host Admin Dashboard for better navigation and clarity. While not a full redesign, this update helps you get things done faster with improved structure and usability.

#### Support for Initial & Current Environment Variable Values

Hoppscotch now supports both **Initial** and **Current** values for environment variables:

- **Initial**: Shared with your team and synced with collections, environments, or globals.
- **Current**: Local-only values, ideal for private or temporary overrides.

This update improves collaboration without compromising privacy.

#### Hawk Authentication

We’ve added support for **Hawk Authentication**, allowing secure, time-sensitive API requests using MAC-based credentials.
