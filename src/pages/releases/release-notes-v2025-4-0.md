#### Self-Host Admin Dashboard UX Improvements

We’ve upgraded the **user experience** of the Self-Host Admin Dashboard for better navigation and clarity. While not a full redesign, this update helps you get things done faster with improved structure and usability.

#### Hawk Authentication

We’ve added support for **Hawk Authentication**, allowing secure, time-sensitive API requests using MAC-based credentials.
