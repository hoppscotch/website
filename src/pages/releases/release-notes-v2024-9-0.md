#### Introducing Hoppscotch Agent 👽

We're introducing a new way to make it easier for developers to work with our web API client. Say hello to the Hoppscotch Agent! This tiny desktop application acts as a native interceptor for API calls. Once installed and configured, Hoppscotch's web client will route your API requests through the Agent, bypassing browser limitations.

#### Save API responses in your collection 💾

You can now save examples of API responses directly in your collection. This means you no longer have to send the same request repeatedly just to see a response—previous responses can be saved alongside their corresponding requests.

<br />

#### Hoppscotch now supports predefined variables ⭐

We’re excited to introduce predefined variables, making it easier to generate dynamic, realistic data during request execution. Use these variables in your requests in the format `$variable`.

<br />

#### Add comments on a JSON request body 💬

Collaborating on API requests just got easier! You can now add comments directly to the JSON request body.
