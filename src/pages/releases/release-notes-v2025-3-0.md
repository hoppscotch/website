#### Deactivate Organization Users

Admins in self-hosted instances can now **deactivate organization users**. This allows you to temporarily disable access without deleting the user, making it easier to manage team membership.

#### Create New Requests Without Siphoning Data

You can now create new requests **without carrying over data** from the previous request, making it easier to start fresh API tests without residual data.

#### Search Environments from the Selector

Quickly find and filter environments through the selector dropdown. This helps you manage multiple environments more efficiently and reduces time spent scrolling through long environment lists.
