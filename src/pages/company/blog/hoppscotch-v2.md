Today we're rolling out [Hoppscotch v2 for everyone](https://hoppscotch.io/) — [GitHub](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch).

In two years, Hoppsotch has grown to:

- **21,000+** monthly users
- **450,000+** all-time users
- **140** contributors
- **30,500+** GitHub stars

For the past two months, we've been working hard on releasing the Hoppscotch v2.0. Special thanks to - [Andrew Bastin](https://dev.to/andrewtheant) for pushing the boundaries and setting the bar high on every aspect of Hoppscotch. [Read how he leads Hoppscotch engineering](https://dev.to/hoppscotch/introducing-hoppscotch-2-0-a-fresh-new-perspective-1j44) and our plans for making an open API development ecosystem for the future.

Starting from v2.0 — we're laying the foundation to build a truly open, transparent, and flexible API development tool.

**We'll be focusing on every life cycle of API development:**

1. **Design**
2. **Development**
3. **Testing**
4. **Deployment**
5. **Consumption**

Our roadmap aligns with this vision.
