_In case you missed it!_

**Story this far:** I joined Zartek, which is a start-up based in Kochi, Kerala where I work as a full-stack developer.

**The story behind Hoppscotch:** The very first task I was assigned is an API integration of an old project. That's when I came across the Postman API testing tool. Postman has separate builds targeted to each operating system made with Electron. I use a low-end PC and can't possibly afford to run another Electron app. From that moment onwards, I wanted to make an API testing platform which is:

- Open Sourced 💚
- Runs online
- Have multi-platform support
- Have multi-device support
- Accessible from anywhere

That's how Hoppscotch was born (this is not at all an alternative to Postman - yet, it does the careers very beautifully and minimally. It needs more features and love which I hope we all can give by [contributing on GitHub](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch)).

When I did a background check on API request builders, Postman offered various Plans & Pricing, there were a lot of other API request builders based on cURL, etc. But none of them seems simple, minimal, and efficient.

That's why I created my own API request builder with pure JavaScript (I used Vue.js) + HTML + CSS 💖

Did I mention this service is all free of charge and 100% open source? Yes, It's free and always will be.

The Hoppscotch API request builder helps you create your requests faster, saving precious time on your development.
