India 🇮🇳 is home to one of the largest communities of student developers in the world. In 2020 we saw the number of students participating in the GitHub Campus program increase by 142 percent, over 100,000 students signed up to GitHub Student Developer Pack, and campus offering was adopted by more than 100 higher-education institutions in India.

This growth is great to see, as the student ecosystem is incredibly important to the continued growth and pace of innovation in India. However, students do not have enough opportunities to get mentorship that can make them real-world-ready and enhance their careers prospects.

### We are super excited to be a ‘Partner Organization’ of [GitHub Externship](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/) and look forward to supporting all interested students to participate and contribute to our [open-source projects](https://github.com/hoppscotch).

> To support the growing community of student developers and to address their needs, GitHub is launching GitHub Externships. This builds on GitHub Campus offering by providing students a unique opportunity to engage with companies in India, via fellowship programs, and build the right skills future developers need, to succeed in an enterprise environment. The program really connects the dots between open source, the next generation of software developers, and successful companies.
> 
> 
> The GitHub Externship is a 90 days fellowship program about learning, preparing students to be market-ready, strengthening industry-academia relations, and giving practical experience to students. This also aims to provide innovative solutions to the partner organizations on their existing challenges, organizations could potentially identify real talent that can be employed by the organizations at later stages.
