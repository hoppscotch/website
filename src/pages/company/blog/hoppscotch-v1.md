# Hoppscotch v1


Author: Liyas Thomas
Date: November 5, 2019
Tags: app, release

So, here’s how [**Hoppscotch**](https://hoppscotch.io/) happened.

You know the drill. You’re developing an app for a client and you need to test every API and every APIs response in every method, on every request.

Our team was already using Postman to test all the variations of an API, but my 7-year-old PC couldn't afford to run another Electron app just to see the request responses in all of them. And that’s how it all started.

How about making a tool where you can test your APIs from your browser itself without switching between apps as you work? That would be neat, huh!

### **How it all began**

The [initial tweet](https://twitter.com/liyasthomas/status/1164497735715893249) about the idea got 250+ likes and 60+ retweets so people were definitely interested in this kind of tool.

I literally launched Hoppscotch on a [dev.to article](https://dev.to/liyasthomas/i-created-postwoman-an-online-open-source-api-request-builder-41md) and wrote about it on Hacker News, HackerNoon, Medium, HashNode, Reddit, Twitter, etc.

No frameworks.
No libraries.
No problems.
He just did it.
Writing JavaScript.
Like a Psychopath.

*It was me 🙃*

I had some problems with CORS in deployment, but I found a quick workaround. I used Vue.js and apparently migrated to Nuxt.js.

At that point, I started thinking that the tool can actually be published as a standalone web app, and the WebSocket testing feature can just be an addition. So I shifted my goal and started working towards that.

I added a few themes, polished up the UI a bit, struggled for 30 mins to come up with a name, and..... *drumroll* Hoppscotch it is. I set up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch) for people who were interested to contribute.

After I [open-sourced the code](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch), polished up the UI, and finished a bunch of other smaller things, [hoppscotch.io](https://hoppscotch.io/) was live 🎉

I actually wrapped up work at 4:30 AM because I just couldn’t go to sleep without finishing *that* *one* *thing* 😅

I was solving my own problem with the hope that I'll also gonna solve other people’s problems. The most important thing is that in the end, you get a lot of amazing and positive feedback, which is basically the only thing that drives you to do better and more awesome work! 🎉

If you think Hoppscotch is worthy of existing as a free, fast alternative to Postman, please consider giving us a confidence boost!
