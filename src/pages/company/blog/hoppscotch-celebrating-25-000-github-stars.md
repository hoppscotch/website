Hoppscotch just received its [25,000th star on GitHub](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch). We'll use this milestone to recap Hoppscotch’s growth and other important milestones since its beginning as an experimental project in 2019. We've accomplished a lot of great things together.

> **To those who don't know what Hoppscotch is:**

Hoppscotch is an open-sourced API request builder used by 100k+ developers. Helps you to create / test / save requests faster, saving precious time on development. An online free, fast and beautiful alternative to Postman / Insomnia, etc.

While tracking the success of an open-source project is known to be a hard problem, we have a few metrics available to us. Currently, 114 developers have contributed to some of the 2570 commits of the [Hoppscotch repository](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch) made available in 7 releases. And this is only data from the main Hoppscotch repo. The ecosystem has [many other repositories](https://github.com/hoppscotch) ranging from [Hoppscotch Browser Extension](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch-extension) (which fixes `CORS` issues) to [Proxyscotch](https://github.com/hoppscotch/proxyscotch) - A simple proxy middleware server.

The number of stars of a GitHub project is yet another indicator because it means people are adding the project to their list of favorites. However, people that starred Hoppscotch are not necessarily users and many users don’t star Hoppscotch (if that applies to you, consider giving us a star!), therefore it's not a precise metric. To date, Hoppscotch has 100k+ all-time users during the span of a year. Which includes ~20k+ monthly users.

Milestones like this are proud moments for the developers & community, help motivate more work & new developments. If you'd like to support Hoppscotch open source project, consider [sponsoring us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/hoppscotch).
